Dentacare had a WordPress site and a Reepay plan for their customers, but they needed some extra features, that Reepay didnâ€™t have. Dentacare wanted a complete integration of Reepay that allowed the customers, to make and manage their subscription without navigating to Reepays website.

With our major experience with Reepay and their system, we developed a plugin that gave Dentacare the functions they needed, including a flexible user interface of the integrated managing system and a form, full compatible with their styling needs. We helped them manage their Reepay and figured out a complete and wholesome solution for their subscription plans. This started the development of ProPay, a complete Reepay plugin.
