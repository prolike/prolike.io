### Join our Techfast - tech for breakfast - and get a glimpse into (forward) cleansing the trend of website and application development
#### "The future is here, it's just not evenly distributed"
-Williab Gibson, SciFi writer, economist, December 2003

The established web development platforms today are typically called Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla Umbraco, SiteCore etc. but, the underlying technologies were developed several years ago!
Back then, the Internet was slow, the servers were expensive, despite it being these specific challenges that they were developed to overcome, the before named platforms have not evolved to a degree worth mentioning compared to general technological advances. Today these technologies are considered as slow, expensive maintenance, unsafe and yes basically obsolete! Alternatives are needed.

Men like Gibson's quote, so it's the future has already arrived, it's just not evenly distributed.

This techfast is for both for you, who already owns a web page or application and for you who is considering to do so in the near future.

We will describe some of the specific challenges where the old technology falls short, as well as provide concrete examples from real life where conversions from the old technology to the new have solved and a number of problems in security, speed, user involvement, testing, release, yes even environmental friendliness and created value for both owner and user.

Fundamentally, nobody in the future should be interested in owning an expensive IT infrastructure themselves. We will describe a serverless approach where websites and features become available as services the boundary between website and application flows together. Everything you dream of having on this site is possible with a modern serverless technology.
