It’s free to attend. Breakfast, coffee during the day, dinner in the evening. 
It’s all taken care of.

#### What are we going to code?


Good question! We have made a [Github repo](https://github.com/prolike/code-cafe-feb20/) containing the issues we are goin to look at. You can suggest your own topic!


The more you contribute to the planning: suggest topics, comment topics, indicate your interests… The better we’ll be prepared.

#### So, what is a CoDe Café?

The Full-Day CoDe Café is facilitated learning with peers and experts in cosy, relaxed ambience. It builds on the principles of situated-learning which defies traditional class-rooom training and emphasize actual learning over mere knowledge transfer. The CoDe Cafés strive to build communities of peers.

#### To code and to CoDe

The name CoDe Café is deliberately spelled in CamelCase: with a capital C and a Capital D in CoDe.  Although the CoDe Café concept was originally developed as an advanced type of [hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) inspired by the [World Café](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_caf%C3%A9) conference/workshop format the word “code” is not referring to code in the meaning of a computer programming language, but to the term “Continuous Delivery” which is widely used in modern software development lingo, and which encapsulates two of the most prominent principles in Lean thinking: “Decide as late as possible” and “Deliver as fast as possible”
