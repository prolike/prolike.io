Welcome to the Tech-fast.

This is the initiation of a series of talks and events, where we the Yipees from prolike, invite you to start the day with dark coffee and bright ideas. Whether you want a modern website or you’re interested in the nitty-gritty of stacks. This is a meetup for you. We'll show you how the future is already here and how we just need to grab it. So get a chair, sit down and enjoy.

Can't wait to learn more?
