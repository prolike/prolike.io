### Wanna become a software owner?

At Prolike, we offer the lean way of programming. The lean way of developing the product you want. Starting with the absolutly nessacary, we program software that pleases your priorities of needs. We are here to make code come alive, we are here to produce your thougths and ideas. We build in the quality by using the lean concept, always improving.

### What does it take to be a software owner?

 Maybe it takes patience? The first thing to know about the deliveries from Prolike, is that they are never higher than 50.000 DDK. We never make more than 50.000 worth of software delivery at a time. 

### MVP - Minimum virable product

MVP is the minumum version of the product you want. Maybe you have a lot of exciting ideas, and that is great! We love that! We'll collect all your thoughts in a workshop, and prio them together. What should come first? What do YOU need as a minimum? What do WE need as a minimum, to make your software come alive? MVP is also a delivery, therefore also a max of 50.000 DDK.

**Feedback**

MVP is also the way for us to quickly get a overview of the user scene. Who want to use the product? What do they think of the product? Is there a audience for the features we are producing?

### When are we done?

Actually we are never done! Software is never "done"! We continue to deliver - continue to improve. Next step after MVP is first delivery. We take the next row of priorities, and add them to the product.

### Workshop

We always begin with a workshop, containing minimum one Elder and two Yeepies - And you. We'll get all the facts straight, we'll write down your needs, wishes and thoughts.
