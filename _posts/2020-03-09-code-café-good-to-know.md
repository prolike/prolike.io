description: Are you attending our Code Café? Here is some ‘good to know’ information.

---
**Create a Github account**

.. if you do not have one. We use Github to manage our issues and to store our code.

Therefore, you should create an account, so that you can participate.

**Welcome**

Prolike has created a Code Café Github account. Click here [https://github.com/code-cafes](https://github.com/code-cafes "https://github.com/code-cafes") and find this month's Code Café repository.

Go to ‘Issues’ and find issue #1 Welcome. If you like, you can write something about yourself here. Name, education, where you come from and why you are participating.

**Assign yourself to issues**

In the repository, you can find the issues that the other attendees have proposed for this month’s Code Café. Assign yourself to the issues you would like to participate in.

**Git and Docker**

It makes sense to have worked a bit with both Git and Docker - if not, then you are still very welcome, but then we would like to know (so we can create an internal group).

**And last**

… remember to bring your computer.
